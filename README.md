Managed a team of five students to strategize and create data models for the development of a relational database compatible with Microsoft SQL Server. 
Conducted migrations to facilitate compatibility with PostgresSQL and MySQL databases. 
Applied reverse engineering techniques to derive physical data models using ERwin DM, followed by a bottom-up approach to normalize physical data modeling into logical and conceptual data models. 
Implemented audit triggers and historical tables to establish comprehensive trail logs for each table.
